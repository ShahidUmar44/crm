## Goals for 4/1

{x} Finish creating the graph page --- plug in with real data from firebase
it's currently sufficient, however if we could also implement some logic that checks whether or not they have salesreps to track the amount of sales - and then show them a graph for that

{} Implement the new estimate page

{x} Events in the schedule that are conditionally rendered based on the status of the job
I believe this is all good actually

{} click through to jobs from the customer page
